 *
 * Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return
 * the total area covered by the two rectangles.
 * 
 * The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (A, B) and its
 * top-right corner (C, D).
 * 
 * The second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (E, F) and its
 * top-right corner (G, H).
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
 * Output: 45
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: A = -2, B = -2, C = 2, D = 2, E = -2, F = -2, G = 2, H = 2
 * Output: 16
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * -10^4 <= A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H <= 10^4
