 *
 * Medium (41.68%)
 * Total Accepted:    35433
 * Total Submissions: 85022
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]\n4'
 *
 * ⁠Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find
 * the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer
 * target.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * nums = [1, 2, 3]
 * target = 4
 * 
 * The possible combination ways are:
 * (1, 1, 1, 1)
 * (1, 1, 2)
 * (1, 2, 1)
 * (1, 3)
 * (2, 1, 1)
 * (2, 2)
 * (3, 1)
 * 
 * Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
 * 
 * Therefore the output is 7.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up:
 * What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array?
 * How does it change the problem?
 * What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers? 
 * 
 * Credits:Special thanks to @pbrother for adding this problem and creating all
 * test cases.
